# Start Code for 2D Graphics: Image Processing

## java

To run the java code, run:

```javac starter.java && java starter```

## html

To run the html code, you need to start a server. One common way to do this with python is:

```py -m http.server```

See this [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) for more details.

In class we will use VS Code and the LiveServer extension.
